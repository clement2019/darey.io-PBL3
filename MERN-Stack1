## SIMPLE TODO APPLICATION ON MERN WEB STACK

The projects show an interface popularly called GUI where a user interacts with the ReactJS UI components
at the software front-end residing in the browser. This frontend is served by the software backend residing in a server,
through ExpressJS running on top of NodeJS. Any interaction or data change request is sent to the NodeJS based Express server,
which collects data from the MongoDB database if required, and returns the data to the frontend of the application,
which is then presented to the user consumption.
